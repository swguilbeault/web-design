          <div id="intro">
               <p> <strong class="a1">I'm not sure how it happened</strong>, but around the time I was in second grade, my mother and I started watching curling on TV together whenever it was on. I was fascinated by the sport. The aspect that really caught
                    my eye was how the rocks moved when they hit each other. I loved seeing the angles come to life, and I loved the strategy behind manipulating them. After just a couple of games, I was hooked. Being from Ontario, it was natural for
                    me to become a fan of the Ontario team at the time: I idolized this team. I still remember how exciting it was the first time that I went to watch them play in person. Little did I know that in 10 years, I would get to know these athletes
                    on a personal level and that some of them would come to know my name.
                    <br><br> The first time I ever stepped on curling ice was at the age of 10 when my middle school offered a small "learn to curl" program after classes finished on Fridays. It was run primarily by a teacher named Ms. Brunberg; she was
                    my science teacher at the time. Having watched the sport on TV so much, I picked it up pretty quickly. For me, the highlight of this program was when a few of us got to play a fun spiel in Toronto (pictured right). As this was the
                    first sport I discovered I had a knack for, I decided to join a curling club the following season.
                    <br><br> Since then, I have had the opportunity to be a member of many teams. As time progressed and our skills developed, we found that local tournaments started lacking the challenge that we were looking for. This is when we decided
                    to play at the most competitive level we could for our age groups. We would practice as often as we could while competing nearly every weekend. I am so fortunate that I was able to do all these things with some of the best teammates
                    - <i>nay, best friends</i> - I could have every asked for.
                    <br><br> To summarize my competitive career thus far, below is a list of the competitive teams I have been a member and our accomplishments. I am nothing but proud of the amazing things that we managed do together, things that the
                    7-year-old version of me could barely dream of. </p>

               <h2><i>2012 - 2019</i></h2>
               <p>This team will forever hold a special place in my heart. This team was both the first competitive team that I played on and the one I played with the longest. We were always proud of being a "home-grown" team, i.e. we were all Hamiltonians
                    curling out of the same club. We won numerous competitive spiels during the years we played together, including countless OJCT events, Junior Slam Series events, and earning silver at the 2018 Ontario Winter Games. However, our proudest
                    moment came in 2019 when we won the <a href="https://saultsports.com/teams-croisier-and-del-conte-crowned-canada-winter-games-trials-champions-in-sault-ste-marie/">OCC provincial in Sault Ste. Marie</a> to earn the privilege of representing
                    both Ontario and Northern Ontario at the <strong>2019 Canada Winter Games</strong>. At this event, we finished the week at 10-2, losing an intense final to BC. Regardless, a silver medal at the national level is still quite an achievement,
                    and we are so overjoyed to have had such an experience.</p>

               <h2><i>2019 - 2020</i></h2>
               <p>I was fortunate to be a part of the University of Guelph's varsity men's curling team during my first year. At the 2020 OUA Championships, we narrowly elimination after round robin and qualified to play in the quarter finals. Here, we upset
                    the top ranked team from the opposite round robin pool and finished the tournament in 3rd place out of 16 teams. This earned us a spot at the <a href="https://usports.ca/en/championships/curling/x/info">2020 USport / Curling Canada Championships</a>,
                    marking
                    <strong>the Guelph men's first appearance since 2011.</strong> Despite being one of the youngest teams at this national, <a href="https://gryphons.ca/news/2020/3/16/general-curling-recap-strong-showing-leads-gryphons-to-4th-place-finish-at-nationals.aspx">we still finished fourth</a>                    out of eight teams.
