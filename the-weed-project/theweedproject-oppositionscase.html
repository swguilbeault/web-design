        <p id=yesBut>COMMON ARGUMENTS</p>
        <p>Below are some rebuttles to many common arguments made against the legalization of marijuana.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class=arguments>
      <div class=argument>
        <h1>Marijuana is illegal because of its negative effects on health:</h1>
        <p>WWhile this may seem obvious, the truth is marijuana is not illegal for health concerns. Instead, it is a result of racism, discrimination, and false facts.<br>In the United States, marijuana was banned in the 1930s. A doctor associated the drug
          with Mexicans in order to save his dying business, and later testified to congress claiming that the drug induced insanity (Adam). Despite the claims being false, the drug was still made illegal and untrue facts were associated with it.<br>In
          the 1920s Canada, the drug was banned in an attempt to stop Chinese immigration on the west coast. Many Chinese immigrants had a dependence on opium, so the government proposed a bill to make its use illegal, in turn discouraging Chinese immigration
          (Carstairs). Marijuana was one of the drugs added to this bill (Carstairs). Oddly enough, opium was later omitted from the bill.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class=argument>
        <h1>Marijuana is a gateway drug:</h1>
        <p>Marijuana is considered a gateway drug, but in reality most who smoke marijuana do not even continue to smoke it, nevermind using more dangerous substances (Adam).
      </div>

      <div class=argument>
        <h1>Marijuana damages the brain:</h1>
        <p>While there is evidence to support that it affects brain development, there is none suggesting that it affects a fully developed brain (Adam). An age restriction on the sale and use of the drug is similar to that for alcohol should be put in place
          with its legalization.
        </p>
      </div>

      <div class=argument>
        <h1>Marijuana is dangerous and can lead to detrimental effects on health:</h1>
        <p> This was one of the main reasons used when it was first criminalized; however, scientists proved that this is completely false in the 1950s (Adam). Despite this finding, the drug still has not been legalized in many places. This is partially due
          to political manipulation. For example, former US president Richard Nixon used the drug’s illegal status as a way to discredit those against his campaign (Adam). One of his advisors, John Ehrlichman, later admitted that they used the drug to
          discredit certain races and demographics despite knowing the drugs themselves were completely harmless.
        </p>

    </div class=arguments>

    <div class=more-info id=ehrlrichman>
      <p> “The Nixon campaign in 1968, and the Nixon White House after that, had two enemies: the antiwar left and black people. You understand what I’m saying? We knew we couldn’t make it illegal to be either against the war or black, but by getting the
        public to associate the hippies with marijuana and blacks with heroin, and then criminalizing both heavily, we could disrupt those communities. We could arrest their leaders, raid their homes, break up their meetings, and vilify them night after
        night on the evening news. Did we know we were lying about the drugs? Of course we did.”</p>
