        <p>but not because of the drug itself. Laws banning the drugs are what make marijuana into a social issue. Some of these problems are detailed below.</p>

      <h1>Marijuana being illegal damages societies<h1><hr>

      <br><p>While laws are implemented to benefit societies, the truth about marijuana’s illegality is that it does the opposite: it damages societies. These laws only require people to possess marijuana in order to lead to conviction. For example, in Canada, a first-time offender could face a maximum fine of $1000 and six months of jail time for the least serious degree of this offence (Posession). While it is rare that a first-time offender would face these maximums, all who are convicted may receive a criminal record (Posession).<br><br>Those charged with possession of marijuana are branded under the same umbrella as those convicted for violent crimes, e.g. rapists, serial killers, pedofiles, and sexual offenders. The possession of marijuana is not a violent crime and the degree of severity is minimal; however, a criminal record puts the offenders intp the same group as those convicted of violent crimes. Consequently, a person charged with possession of marijuana may have difficulty om travelling to certain countries, finding employment, and generally fitting into society. This punishment is much too drastic for the severity of the crime.</p>

      <h1>Laws prohibiting the substance do not prevent its use<h1><hr>

      <br><p>Many people believe the purpose for banning marijuana was to prevent its use; however, the laws fail to stop it. In reality, it is still extremely easy to get the drug. Many stores sell it for medical reasons but also sell it to walk-in customers (Posession). While this may not be legal, in reality this is what is happening.<br><br>Additionally, the consequences for those convicted of possession fail to deter users from possessing and using the substance. For example, 20% of Canadians admitted they smoked marijuana in 2014 (Evans), and 52% of Americans over the age of 18 admitted to having used it in their lifetimes (O'Hara). These numbers make it clear that these laws are not preventing the drug’s use.</p>

      <h1>The government cannot monitor sales<h1><hr>

      <br><p>These laws also prevent the government from regulating the sales of the substance. Since stores cannot sell the drug legally, transactions are done off-the-book, resulting in loss revenue for the government. Additionally, acquiring the substance this way is much less safe as sellers are under no obligation to deliver the substance in any specific sort of form and quality. Products can easily contain drugs other than marijuana, including those with more addictive qualities and harmful effects.</p>
